#BitLocker Endpoint Objects:


##TPM chip Status Data: (I publish this data to Back-End)

{
	specVersion:(float),
    manufacturerId:(STR),
	manufacturerName:(STR),
    chipSupport:(bool),
	biosActivation:(bool)
}
* Single object.

Notes:

specVersion: must be higher than 1.2
chipSupport: must be true
biosActivation: must be true

***if these conditions are not `met`, then we dont have BitLocker services for that device and BitLocker setting and profile for that device are disabled.

{
	drives :[
				{
					driveLetter(STR): {
					driveType:ENUM["OS Drive", "Fixed Drive", "Removable Drive"],
					bitlockerStatus:ENUM ["BitLocker Disabled", "BitLocker Enabled", "BitLocker Encryption in Progress", "BitLocker Decryption in Progress", "Bitlocker Encryption Paused", "Bitlocker Decryption Paused"],
                    conversionPercentage:(int),
                    bitlockerIdentifier:(STR, Nullable),
                    bitlockerRecoveryKey:(STR, Nullable),
					passPhrase:(STR, Nullable),
					ownerhip:ENUM["trio", "user"] 
					}
				},
			]
}
* List of objects.

Notes:
driveLetter Examples: "C:", "D:", "E:", "F:"
driveType ENUM: "OS Drive", "Fixed Drive", "Removable Drive"
bitlockerStatus ENUM: "BitLocker Disabled", "BitLocker Enabled", "BitLocker Encryption in Progress", "BitLocker Decryption in Progress", "Bitlocker Encryption Paused", "Bitlocker Decryption Paused"
ownerhip ENUM: "trio" means it is not interfered by user. "user" means BitLocker was changed by user on device.

##BitLocker Setting Object: (I subscribe to this data from Back-End)

{	
	[
		{
			activationCommand:(bool),
			passPhrase:(STR,Nullable),
			driveLetter:(STR)
		},
	]
}
* List of objects.

Notes:
activationCommand: True or False
	- True: means enabling the BitLocker on said drive.
	- False: means disableing the BitLocker on said drive.
passPhrase: if the actionType is setting, I get the password from pannel. if the actionType is profile, i auto generate the password myself.
driveLetter Examples: "C:", "D:", "E:", "F:"


##BitLocker Profile Object:(I subscribe to this data on profile object from Back-End)

bitlocker:{
	activationCommand:bool
}

if the command is in profile: 
True: means BitLocker will be enabled on all drives.
False: means BitLocker will be disabled on all drives.
